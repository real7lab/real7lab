## 👋 Hi, I’m Lab

💻 **Software enthusiast and researcher** focused on **systems programming**, **Windows internals**, and **reverse engineering**.  
I enjoy exploring low-level software behavior — from **process execution** and **runtime analysis** to the **forensic traces** left behind by the operating system.


## 🛠️ Technical Interests
- Systems and low-level programming
- Windows internals and execution artifacts
- Reverse engineering and binary analysis
- Backend tooling and automation

## 🧠 Previous Project — Vision Software (2023–2025)

**Vision Software** was a publicly available research and development project focused on **Windows internals**, **execution behavior**, and **forensic artifact analysis**.
The project focused on studying how software interacts with the Windows operating system at runtime and how execution activity is represented across system artifacts.

In parallel, the project also involved the development of **software related to the FiveM ecosystem**, serving as a controlled environment for applying and validating low-level systems and runtime concepts.

**Key areas of work:**
- Analysis of Windows execution and runtime artifacts
- Process and module behavior inspection
- Static and dynamic reverse engineering
- Development of custom tooling and proof-of-concepts
- Application of low-level techniques within controlled game environments

**Technologies used:**  
C++ • Go • Windows APIs

**Status:** Closed / Archived

## 🔬 Reverse Engineering

I am interested in **reverse engineering** as a discipline for:
- Understanding software behavior and execution flow
- Static and dynamic binary analysis
- Research, learning, and interoperability purposes
